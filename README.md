# 2016-US-Presidential-Elections-Machine-Learning-Project

This project consists of analyizing the 2016 US presidential elections. Using R's various machine learning algorithms, our aim is to get a better understanding as to why many predictive models fail to predict the outcome of the elections. 

The R markdown file with all the raw code is labeled as 2016 Elections Project, while a PDF with all the graphs, models and visualizations is shown in the '2016 elections PDF' file along with their corresponding kernels. **I recommend checking out the PDF in order to get a better understanding of the project.**

We used 3 datasets, elections, census and metadata for this project, as found in the 3 csv files found in the repository. They contain information regarding the demographic of the United States at the time of the elections, as well as some info regarding political parties, etc.

Enjoy!
